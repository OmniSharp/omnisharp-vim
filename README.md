# OmniSharp

OmniSharp-vim is a plugin for Vim to provide IDE like abilities for C#. A list of currently implemented features is provided below.

OmniSharp works both on Windows and on Linux and OS X with Mono.

The plugin uses the [OmniSharp server](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server) which is a thin wrapper around the awesome [NRefactory] (https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory) library, and it provides the same completions as MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop. 

The server knows nothing about Vim, so could be plugged into most editors fairly easily.
[Emacs](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs),
[Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/PaulCampbell/OmniSharpSublimePlugin) and [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-sublime) all have completion plugins utilising the OmniSharp server.

Omnisharp-vim can now be run with the [omnisharp-roslyn server](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn) as an alternative to the Omnisharp Server.

## Features

* Contextual code completion
  * Code documentation is displayed in the preview window when available (Xml Documentation for Windows, MonoDoc documentation for Mono)
  * CamelCase completions are supported, e.g Console.WL(TAB) will complete to Console.WriteLine
  * "Subsequence" completions are also supported. e.g. Console.Wline would also complete to Console.WriteLine
  * Completions are ranked in the following order
    * Exact start match (case sensitive)
    * Exact start match (case insensitive)
    * CamelCase completions
    * Subsequence match completions
  * Completion snippets are supported. e.g. Console.WriteLine(TAB) (ENTER) will complete to Console.WriteLine(string value) and expand a dynamic snippet, this will place you in SELECT mode and the first method argument will be selected. 
    * Requires [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) and supports standard C-x C-o completion, [Supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) and [Neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim).
    * Requires `set completeopt-=preview` when using [Neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) because of a compatibility issue with [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). 
    * This functionality requires a recent version of Vim, you can check if your version is supported by running `:echo has("patch-7.3-598")`, it should output 1.

* Jump to the definition of a type/variable/method
* Find types/symbols interactively (requires [CtrlP](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim) plugin or [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) plugin)
* Find implementations/derived types
* Find usages
* Contextual code actions (sort usings, use var....etc.) (requires [CtrlP](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim) plugin or [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) plugin)
  * Extract method
* Find and fix code issues (unused usings, use base type where possible....etc.) (requires [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) plugin)
* Fix using statements for the current buffer (sort, remove and add any missing using statements where possible)
* Rename refactoring
* Semantic type highlighting
* Lookup type information of an type/variable/method
  * Can be printed to the status line or in the preview window
  * Displays documentation for an entity when using preview window
* Syntax error highlighting
* On the fly semantic error highlighting (nearly as good as a full compilation!)
* Integrated xbuild/msbuild (can run asynchronously if vim dispatch is installed)
* Code formatter
* Automatic folding of `# region` and `<summary></summary>` (make sure to have `set foldmethod=syntax`)
* Add currently edited file to the nearest project (currently will only add .cs files to a .csproj file)

```vim
:OmniSharpAddToProject
```

* Add reference. Supports project and file reference. GAC referencing todo.

```vim
:OmniSharpAddReference path_to_reference
```

* [Test runner](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim/wiki/Test-Runner)

## Installation

[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is the recommended way to install OmniSharp.

#### OSX / Linux

Requires a minimum of Mono 3.0.12 - If you absolutely must use mono 2.10 then checkout the mono-2.10.8 tag. [Updating mono on ubuntu](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server/wiki)

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim.git
cd omnisharp-vim
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd server
xbuild
```

If you installed the package with Vundle, you still need to build the server as above.

Note that if you have Mono installed outside of the ["standard" paths](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server/blob/master/OmniSharp/Solution/AssemblySearch.cs#L35-L52) (for example, if it is installed via Boxen where your homebrew root is not `/usr/local/`, you'll need to either add the path to the `AssemblySearch.cs` before building, or symlink your installation to one of the standard paths.

If you are planning to use OmniSharp-Roslyn, run the following commands:
```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle/omnisharp-vim/omnisharp-roslyn
./build.sh
```

#### Windows

```dosbatch
c:\
cd c:\Users\username\vimfiles\bundle
git clone https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim.git
cd omnisharp-vim
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd server
msbuild
```

### Install Python

Install last version of Python 3. Make sure that you pick correct version of Python to match the architecture of Vim.
For example, if you installed Vim using the default Windows installer, you will need to install the x86 (32 bit!) version of Python.

Whilst Python 2.7 series is supported ([Python 2.7.12] (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.12/) at the time of this writing), it is highly advisable to use the latest Python version.

Verify that Python is working inside Vim with

```vim
:echo has('python3')
```

or

```vim
:echo has('python')
```

if you cannot use Python 3 due to some reason.

### (optional) Install vim-dispatch
The vim plugin [vim-dispatch] (https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) is needed to make OmniSharp start the server automatically and for running asynchronous builds.
Use your favourite way to install it.

### (optional) Install syntastic
The vim plugin [syntastic] (https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is needed for displaying code issues and syntax errors.
Use your favourite way to install it.

### (optional) Install ctrlp.vim, unite.vim or fzf.vim

If you want to use the Code Actions, Find Type and Find Symbol features, you will need to install one of the following plugins:

- [CtrlP](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim)
- [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)
- [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)

If you have installed more than one, you can choose one by `g:OmniSharp_selector_ui` variable.

```vim
let g:OmniSharp_selector_ui = 'unite'  " Use unite.vim
let g:OmniSharp_selector_ui = 'ctrlp'  " Use ctrlp.vim
let g:OmniSharp_selector_ui = 'fzf'    " Use fzf.vim
```

## How to use

By default, the server is started automatically if you have vim-dispatch installed when you open a .cs file.
It tries to detect your solution file (.sln) and starts the OmniSharp server passing the path to the solution file.

If you are using Tmux, the server will start in a new tmux session. In iterm2, a new tab is opened. Windows starts the server with a minimised cmd shell. For any other configuration, the server will start invisibly in the background.


This behaviour can be disabled by setting `let g:Omnisharp_start_server = 0` in your vimrc.

When your close vim, and the OmniSharp server is running, vim will ask you if you want to stop the OmniSharp server.
This behaviour can be disabled by setting `let g:Omnisharp_stop_server = 0` in your vimrc.

In addition you can tweak some OmniSharp server behaviour by changing the global configuration file placed:

#### OSX / Linux

```sh
~/.vim/bundle/omnisharp-vim/server/config.json
```

#### Windows

```dosbatch
c:\Users\<username>\vimfiles\bundle\omnisharp-vim\server\config.json
```

Or by providing a local version, that by default called `omnisharp.json` and placed in the same solution directory.
If you want use another configuration file name, you should set `let g:Omnisharp_server_config_name = '<your file name>.json'` variable in the vimrc.

Alternatively, you can start the OmniSharp server manually:

```
[mono] OmniSharp.exe -p (portnumber) -s (path\to\sln)
```

Add `-config (path\to\json) Configuration` to provide a server configuration file.
Add `-v Verbose` to get extra information from the server.

OmniSharp listens to requests from Vim on port 2000 by default, so make sure that your firewall is configured to accept requests from localhost on this port.

To get completions, open one of the C# files from the solution within Vim and press `<C-x><C-o>` (that is ctrl x followed by ctrl o) in Insert mode
(or just TAB if you have [SuperTab] (https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) installed).
Repeat to cycle through completions, or use the cursor keys (eugh!)

If you prefer to get completions as you are typing, then you should take a look at [NeoComplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim), [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
or [NeoComplCache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim).


NeoComplCache is the easiest to set up as it is pure vimscript. However, it's no longer maintained. NeoComplete is the successor to NeoComplCache. It is faster than NeoComplCache but requires Vim to be compiled with +lua. (Windows users can find [vim compiled with +lua](https://tuxproject.de/projects/vim/) and [Lua 5.2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.2.1/Executables/) - place lua52.dll in the same folder as gvim.exe) . OSX users can `brew install vim --HEAD --with-lua`

YouCompleteMe is also fast, but is tricky to setup on Windows - trivial on linux or OSX.

[NeoComplete example settings](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim/wiki/Example-NeoComplete-Settings)

[NeoComplCache example settings](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim/wiki/Example-NeoComplCache-Settings)

Simple syntax error highlighting is automatically performed when saving the current buffer or leaving insert mode.

To use the other features, you'll want to create key bindings for them. See the example vimrc below for more info.

### Using with omnisharp-roslyn

OmniSharp-vim can now be run with [omnisharp-roslyn](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn) instead of the OmniSharp server.
To switch, write one of the below lines to your vimrc.

```
let g:OmniSharp_server_type = 'v1'
let g:OmniSharp_server_type = 'roslyn'
```

### Other useful tools

- [grunt-init-csharpsolution](https://github.com/nosami/grunt-init-csharpsolution) Useful for quickly creating a C# solution with a couple of projects. Easily adaptable.
